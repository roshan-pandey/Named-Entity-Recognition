# Named Entity Recognition

## Objective
The aim of this project is to perform named entity recognition on the text provided. Our goal is to recognize only Locations and Dates... 
However, we will perform named entity recognition for all the pre-defined entities in the SpaCy library and later on we will pick only those which are of our interest (Locations and Dates).

## Steps of Execution
- Load the modelling.ipynb in your fav. text editor or google colab.
- Install datasets, SpaCy package. [pip install datasets, pip install spacy]
- Hit run all to execute all the cells! Easy :)
